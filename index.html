            <h1>Honey Reddy Nagireddy</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Computer Science Student</p>
            <p>As an undergraduate Computer Science student at Iowa State University, I bring a passion for technology
                and a commitment to academic excellence. Anticipated to graduate in December 2025, my journey
                encompasses diverse experiences, including a notable tenure at Auburn University. I've delved into
                impactful projects, such as developing a sophisticated Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a Mercedes
                Vehicle's shifting Console System, showcasing my proficiency in Python and collaborative skills. Beyond
                academia, my work at Auburn University Bookstore and Starbucks reflects my dedication to customer
                service, inventory management, and team collaboration. As a current Catering Server at ISU Catering, I
                continue to refine my organizational and leadership abilities. Engaging with clubs like WebDev, Girls
                Who Code, and Data Science Club, I contribute to a vibrant tech community, fostering both personal and
                professional growth. My academic achievements, including being on the Dean's List, underscore my
                commitment to excellence. In essence, my academic journey, coupled with diverse work experiences,
                reflects a holistic approach to Computer Science, complemented by a strong work ethic and a
                collaborative spirit. </p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>
                    In Project 2, as a Developer for Project Simply Shift at Auburn University's Samuel Ginn College of
                    Engineering, I played a key role in the creation of a sophisticated Graphical User Interface (GUI)
                    using Python. This GUI was specifically designed to operate a shifting Console System in a Mercedes
                    Vehicle. Leveraging my programming skills, I successfully implemented four advanced functions within
                    the GUI â€“ controlling the Gear shift, Temperature, Radio/Stereo, and seat adjustments. Collaboration
                    was integral, as I worked alongside four teammates to build a functional prototype. This experience
                    not only enhanced my proficiency in Python but also honed my teamwork and presentation skills as we
                    showcased our design to the lab, class, and professors.</p>
